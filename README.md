# A Resource Tracer project
- A resource tracing, debugging and profiling tool

Crossplatform method to trace software errors in runtime during resource manipulation is shown. A scheme for describing abstract resources and their functions in XML is presented. Due to separation it's possible to describe vast classes of resources without changing the analyzer core. Detected errors often have an influence on security, safety, robustness and resource optimal usage.
