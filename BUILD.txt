One can build ART with few options:

1. with GNU Make
Pros: it's GNU Make
Cons: current Makefiles doesn't contain depend-targets, so you can build
from scratch with it, but if you change source, you have to make clean and then
make again.

2. with SCons
Pros: It watchs depends, so you can safely call scons if you changed source.
Cons: you have to install SCons

3. with ./bulkbuild.sh
Pros: If you have just to build source, you can call it.
      You don't need GNU Make or SCons
Cons: it's hardcoded with compiler name and it options, but one can easily change it
for appropriate environment.

4. with ./make-distro-dynamic.sh <version> (it uses SCons currently)
To build binaries
